## About

This is the modpack for my private Minecraft server. It is built from scratch using various mods and is currently running on Minecraft 1.19.4.

The modpack is built using the [PrismMC Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) to test and run it, and [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/downloads), which is used as the pack creator and exporting tool. The modpack is hosted on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/ms-server-pack) and [GitHub](https://github.com/TheModdersDen/MonsterSpawned-Pack/releases).
